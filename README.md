# RUL-Estimation
Predict the RUL of an engine using run-to-failure dataset
This project shows how to build a complete Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation workflow including the steps for preprocessing, selecting trendable features, constructing a health indicator by sensor fusion, training similarity RUL estimators, and validating prognostics performance. The training data was obtained from the PHM2008 challenge dataset (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/).
