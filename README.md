# RUL-Estimation
Predictive maintenance helps to understand the right time to carry out maintenance on a faulty engine or any other equipment, saving cost in the process. This project was built to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an engine using run-to-failure dataset. It shows how to build a complete RUL estimation workflow including the steps for preprocessing, selecting trendable features, constructing a health indicator by sensor fusion, training similarity RUL estimators, and validating prognostics performance. The training data was obtained from the PHM2008 challenge dataset (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/).

The SimilarityRUL is the livescript to obtain the RUL, while the other files are the helperfunctions that are needed in the code. The helperfunctions were obtained from MATLAB's predictive maintainance toolbox and were developed by the Mathworks Inc.
